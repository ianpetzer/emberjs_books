This is a demo-app for Ember.js, using a Rails server

If you have rails installed on your machine, you can clone this repo and start up a Rails server in this directory. The app is hosted at localhost:3000

All of the Ember.js functionality can be found at in the assets/javascript folder.

In the store.js file you can choose which adapter you want Ember-Data to use. The FixtureAdapter will keep everything in the browser. The RestAdapter will delegate to the server to perform the CRUD operations on the entities
